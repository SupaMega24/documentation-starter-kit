# KYC Contract

The `KYC.sol` contract is responsible for handling the onboarding and registration of sellers onto the RunBRO platform via a decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer) process. The registration process is governed by the DAO members through proposals and voting mechanisms. The contract also integrates with the `RunBroToken` to check user token holdings.

---

### **Key Features**

- **Proposal System**: DAO members can propose new sellers for registration on the platform. Proposals go through a voting process to determine whether the seller is approved.
- **Voting System**: DAO members can cast their votes either in favor of or against a proposal. The result of the vote will decide if the user gets registered.
- **Registration**: Once a proposal passes, the user is registered as a seller on the platform.

### **Contract Variables**

- **sellerCount**: Tracks the total number of sellers who have submitted their details for registration.
- **proposal_counter**: Tracks the total number of proposals created.
- **sellerDetails**: A mapping that stores the TikTok URL or other relevant details for each seller by their address.
- **proposalIdOfSeller**: A mapping that links each seller's address to their proposal ID.
- **proposedAddressArray**: An array that stores all proposed addresses (sellers awaiting DAO approval).
- **abc**: An array that stores all seller addresses that have submitted their details.
- **proposals**: A mapping of proposal IDs to the `Proposal` struct containing proposal details.
- **proposalCount**: A counter for the total number of proposals created.
- **members**: A mapping that tracks which addresses are members of the DAO.
- **hasVoted**: A nested mapping that tracks which DAO members have voted on which proposals.
- **votingPeriod**: The duration for which voting remains open (default: 5 minutes).
- **addUserToPlatform**: A mapping that stores the registration status of sellers after they pass the DAO voting process.
- **rbToken**: A reference to the `RunBroToken` contract, used to check the token holdings of users.

Allows a DAO member to propose a new user (seller) for registration. Creates a proposal and starts the voting process for that proposal.

- **Returns**: 
  - `proposalId`: The ID of the newly created proposal.

#### **vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)**
Allows a DAO member to vote on a proposal. The member can vote either in favor of (`support = true`) or against (`support = false`) the proposal.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `proposalId`: The ID of the proposal.
  - `support`: A boolean indicating whether the voter supports the proposal.

#### **queueProposal(uint256 proposalId)**
After voting has ended and a proposal has passed, this function queues the proposal for execution.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `proposalId`: The ID of the proposal.

#### **executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)**
Executes the proposal, registering the user as a seller if the proposal passed.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `proposalId`: The ID of the proposal.

#### **_registerUser(address _user)**
An internal function that registers a user as a seller by updating the `addUserToPlatform` mapping.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `_user`: The address of the user being registered.

- **Returns**: 
  - The proposal ID.

#### **getAllProposedAccounts()**
Returns all the proposed seller addresses.

- **Returns**: 
  - An array of addresses.

#### **getVotingStatus(uint256 proposalId)**
Returns the voting status of a specific proposal, including the number of votes for, votes against, and whether the voting is still active.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `proposalId`: The ID of the proposal.

### **Workflow Overview**

1. **User Submits Details**: A user submits their details (e.g., TikTok URL) for registration.
2. **DAO Member Proposes User**: A DAO member proposes the user for registration by creating a proposal.
3. **DAO Members Vote**: DAO members vote on the proposal.
4. **Proposal Queued**: If the proposal passes, it is queued for execution.
5. **User Registered**: After execution, the user is registered as a seller on the platform.

This decentralized process ensures that the DAO governs the onboarding of sellers, making the process transparent and community-driven.
