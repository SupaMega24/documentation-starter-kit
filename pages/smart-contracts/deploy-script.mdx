# Deploy Script

---

**UPDATE 8/21/2024 @1251 AM**

## **New Script - DeployDAO.s.sol**

A new script file, `DeployDAO.s.sol`, has been introduced. This script handles the deployment of the DAO separately from other contract deployments.

### **Purpose of `DeployDAO.s.sol`**

- **Deployment of DAO**: This script is responsible for deploying the `RBGovernor` and related contracts that manage DAO governance.
- **Modular Deployment**: Having a separate script for DAO deployment allows for modular deployment of the smart contract system, making the process more efficient and manageable.

### **Usage**

- This script should be executed as part of the deployment process to ensure that the DAO is correctly deployed and configured according to your requirements.

## DeployContracts.s.sol

### Overview
The `DeployContracts` script is used to deploy and initialize various smart contracts required for the RunBro ecosystem. This includes deploying the `RunBroToken`, `Escrow`, `WethRegistry`, `MarketPlace`, `GetStepsAPI`, `WethReward`, and DAO-related contracts (`Lock` and `RBGovernor`).

### Inheritance
The script inherits from:
- `Script`: Provides functionality for running deployment scripts in Foundry.

### Constants
- `wethAddress`: The address of the WETH token contract on Sepolia (or Amoy, commented out).
- `initialSupply`: The initial supply of RunBroTokens.
- `initial_rbTokens_inPool`: The initial amount of RunBroTokens in the pool.
- `initial_weth_inPool`: The initial amount of WETH in the pool.
- `MIN_DELAY`: The minimum delay for the DAO timelock (1 hour).
- `QUORUM_PERCENTAGE`: The quorum percentage required for DAO proposals (4%).
- `VOTING_PERIOD`: The voting period for DAO proposals.
- `VOTING_DELAY`: The delay before a proposal vote becomes active.

### Variables
- `seller`: The address of the seller.
- `buyer`: The address of the buyer.
- `owner`: The address of the contract owner.
- `proposers`: An array of proposer addresses for the DAO.
- `executors`: An array of executor addresses for the DAO.
- `lock`: The `Lock` contract instance for the DAO.
- `rbgovernor`: The `RBGovernor` contract instance for the DAO.

### Functions

#### `run`
```solidity
function run() external
```
- **Description**: Deploys and initializes the various contracts required for the RunBro ecosystem. It also sets up the DAO with the `Lock` and `RBGovernor` contracts.

### Deployment Steps
1. **Deploy RunBroToken**:
   - Deploys the `RunBroToken` contract with the initial supply.
2. **Deploy Escrow**:
   - Deploys the `Escrow` contract.
3. **Deploy WethRegistry**:
   - Deploys the `WethRegistry` contract.
4. **Deploy MarketPlace**:
   - Deploys the `MarketPlace` contract with the addresses of `WethRegistry`, `WETH`, `Escrow`, and `RunBroToken`.
5. **Deploy GetStepsAPI**:
   - Deploys the `GetStepsAPI` contract with the address of `WethRegistry`.
6. **Deploy WethReward**:
   - Deploys the `WethReward` contract with the addresses of `WETH`, `MarketPlace`, `WethRegistry`, and `GetStepsAPI`.
7. **Deploy DAO Contracts**:
   - Deploys the `Lock` contract with the minimum delay, proposers, and executors.
   - Deploys the `RBGovernor` contract with the `RunBroToken` and `Lock` contracts.
8. **Setup DAO Roles**:
   - Grants the proposer role to the `RBGovernor` contract.
   - Grants the executor role to the zero address (open execution).
   - Revokes the admin role from the deployer.

### Console Logs
- Logs the addresses of the deployed contracts for reference.
