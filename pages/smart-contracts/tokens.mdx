## RunBroToken.sol

### Overview
The `RunBroToken` contract is an ERC20 token with additional features from OpenZeppelin's libraries. It includes ownership control, permit functionality, and voting capabilities.

### Inheritance
The contract inherits from the following OpenZeppelin contracts:
- `ERC20`: Standard ERC20 token implementation.
- `Ownable`: Provides basic authorization control functions.
- `ERC20Permit`: Adds permit functionality, allowing approvals via signatures.
- `ERC20Votes`: Adds voting capabilities to the token.

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor(uint256 initialSupply)
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `initialSupply`: The initial supply of tokens to be minted.
- **Description**: Initializes the contract by setting the token name to "RunBroToken" and symbol to "RBT". It also mints the initial supply of tokens to the deployer's address.

### Functions

#### `safeTransfer`
```solidity
function safeTransfer(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `to`: The address to transfer tokens to.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens to transfer.
- **Modifiers**: 
  - `onlyOwner`: Only the contract owner can call this function.
- **Description**: Transfers tokens to the specified address. This function is restricted to the contract owner.

#### `_afterTokenTransfer`
```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20, ERC20Votes)
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `from`: The address from which tokens are transferred.
  - `to`: The address to which tokens are transferred.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens transferred.
- **Description**: Hook that is called after any transfer of tokens. It ensures that the voting power is updated accordingly.

#### `mint`
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `to`: The address to mint tokens to.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens to mint.
- **Description**: Mints new tokens to the specified address. This function can be called by anyone.

#### `_mint`
```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20, ERC20Votes)
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `to`: The address to mint tokens to.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens to mint.
- **Description**: Internal function to mint new tokens. It ensures that the voting power is updated accordingly.

#### `_burn`
```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20, ERC20Votes)
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `account`: The address from which tokens are burned.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens to burn.
- **Description**: Internal function to burn tokens. It ensures that the voting power is updated accordingly.

### Notes
- The contract uses OpenZeppelin's libraries to ensure security and standard compliance.
- The `safeTransfer` function is restricted to the contract owner to prevent unauthorized transfers.
- The `_afterTokenTransfer`, `_mint`, and `_burn` functions are overridden to ensure that the voting power is updated correctly.
