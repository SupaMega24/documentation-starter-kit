**UPDATE 8/20/2024**

## **wethRegistry.sol - Updates**

### **1. Changes to `distributeBalancetoSlot`**

The function `distributeBalancetoSlot` now distributes funds in an **80:20 ratio**:

- **80%** of the funds are allocated as rewards based on user steps.
- **20%** of the funds are allocated as rewards based on the `rbFactor` of the user's shoe.

This change is crucial as it introduces a dual reward mechanism, rewarding both user activity and the attributes of their digital items (shoes).

### **2. Updated `Slot` Struct**

The `Slot` struct has been updated with two new members to support the reward distribution changes:

```solidity
struct Slot {
    uint256 slotId;
    uint256 numberOfUsers;
    address[] users;
    uint256[] rbfs;       // Array storing rbFactors for users in the slot
    uint256 rewardFund;    // Fund allocated for step-based rewards
    uint256 rbRewardFund;  // Fund allocated for rbFactor-based rewards
}
```

- **`rbfs`**: An array that holds the `rbFactor` values of the users in the slot.
- **`rbRewardFund`**: The amount of funds dedicated to rewards based on `rbFactor`.

These two new members allow for a separate fund distribution based on the user's shoe `rbFactor`.

## WethRegistry.sol

### Overview
The `WethRegistry` contract manages user slots and distributes rewards based on the reserve balance. It uses Chainlink Automation to ensure timely distribution of rewards.

### Inheritance
The contract inherits from:
- `AutomationCompatibleInterface`: Provides compatibility with Chainlink Automation.

### Constructor
No constructor is defined in this contract.

### Structs
- **Slot**: Represents a slot with attributes like slot ID, number of users, users, and reward fund.

### Mappings
- `s_slot`: Maps slot IDs to `Slot` structs.
- `s_userSlotId`: Maps user addresses to their slot IDs.

### Functions

#### `_createSlot`
```solidity
function _createSlot(uint256 _slotId) internal
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_slotId`: The ID of the slot to create.
- **Description**: Creates a new slot with the given ID.

#### `_addUserToSlot`
```solidity
function _addUserToSlot(uint256 _slotId, address _user) public
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_slotId`: The ID of the slot to add the user to.
  - `_user`: The address of the user to add.
- **Description**: Adds a user to the specified slot. If the slot is full, a new slot is created.

#### `_updateSlotCountAndCreateNewSlot`
```solidity
function _updateSlotCountAndCreateNewSlot() internal
```
- **Description**: Updates the slot count and creates a new slot if the current slot is full.

#### `_updateReserveBalance`
```solidity
function _updateReserveBalance(uint256 _amount) public
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_amount`: The amount to add to the reserve balance.
- **Description**: Updates the reserve balance by adding the specified amount.

#### `setRandomSlotData`
```solidity
function setRandomSlotData(uint256 _slotId, uint256 _numberOfUsers, address[] memory _users, uint256 _rewardFund) public
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_slotId`: The ID of the slot.
  - `_numberOfUsers`: The number of users in the slot.
  - `_users`: The array of user addresses.
  - `_rewardFund`: The reward fund for the slot.
- **Description**: Sets random data for a slot.

#### `distributeBalanceToSlot`
```solidity
function distributeBalanceToSlot() public
```
- **Description**: Distributes the reserve balance to all slots. This function is called by Chainlink Automation.

#### `checkUpkeep`
```solidity
function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata /* checkData */) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory /* performData */)
```
- **Description**: Checks if upkeep is needed based on the distribution timestamp.

#### `performUpkeep`
```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata /* performData */) external override
```
- **Description**: Performs upkeep by updating the distribution timestamp.

### View Functions
- `_getReserveBalance()`: Returns the reserve balance.
- `_getSlotData(uint256 _slotId)`: Returns the data for a specific slot.
- `_getUserSlotId(address _user)`: Returns the slot ID for a specific user.
- `_getCurrentNumberOfSlots()`: Returns the current number of slots.
- `rewardAllotmentToDifferentSlots()`: Returns the reward allotment to different slots.
