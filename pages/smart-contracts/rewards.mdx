# Reward Model

---

**UPDATE 8/20/2024**

## **wethRewardModel.sol - New Function**

### **_calculateShareOfUserRBfactorInSlot**

A new function `_calculateShareOfUserRBfactorInSlot` has been added, which calculates the share of the `rbRewardFund` that a user should receive based on their shoe’s `rbFactor`.

```solidity
function _calculateShareOfUserRBfactorInSlot(address _account, uint256 _shoeid) internal view returns(uint256) {
    uint256 userSlotId = i_wethRegistry._getUserSlotId(_account);
    (, , address[] memory usersInSlot, uint256[] memory rbfs, , uint256 rbRewardFund) = i_wethRegistry._getSlotData(userSlotId);

    uint256 totalrbfs;
    uint256 userrbfs = i_marketplace.getShoeRB_Factor(_shoeid);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        totalrbfs += rbfs[i];
    }

    return (userrbfs * rbRewardFund * SCALING_FACTOR) / totalrbfs;
}
```

- **Purpose**: This function calculates a user's share of the reward based on the `rbFactor` of their shoe, relative to the total `rbFactors` within the slot.
- **Inputs**:
  - `_account`: The user's address.
  - `_shoeid`: The ID of the shoe whose `rbFactor` will be used for the calculation.
- **Logic**: It retrieves the user's slot ID and gathers slot data, including all users' `rbFactors`. It then calculates the user’s share of the `rbRewardFund` based on the ratio of their `rbFactor` to the total `rbFactors` in the slot.

## WethRewardModel.sol

### Overview
The `WethReward` contract integrates with the `MarketPlace`, `GetStepsAPI`, and `WethRegistry` contracts to manage and distribute rewards based on user activity and steps data. It uses WETH for reward distribution.

### Inheritance
The contract does not inherit from any other contracts but interacts with several imported contracts:
- `MarketPlace`
- `GetStepsAPI`
- `WethRegistry`
- `IWETH` (interface)

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor(address _wethToken, address _marketPlace, address _wethRegistry, address _getStepsApi)
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_wethToken`: Address of the WETH token contract.
  - `_marketPlace`: Address of the MarketPlace contract.
  - `_wethRegistry`: Address of the WethRegistry contract.
  - `_getStepsApi`: Address of the GetStepsAPI contract.
- **Description**: Initializes the contract by setting the addresses of the WETH token, MarketPlace, WethRegistry, and GetStepsAPI contracts.

### Mappings
- `s_startingTime`: Maps user addresses to their starting time.
- `s_userStepsAtMoment`: Maps user addresses and timestamps to their steps count.
- `s_userSteps`: Maps user addresses to their total steps.
- `s_stepShareOfUser`: Maps user addresses to their share of steps.
- `s_totalStepsPerSlot`: Maps slot IDs to the total steps in that slot.
- `s_userRewards`: Maps user addresses to their rewards.
- `s_claimedReward`: Tracks whether a user has claimed their reward.

### Functions

#### `sendRequestToFetchSteps`
```solidity
function sendRequestToFetchSteps(string memory authToken) public
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `authToken`: Authorization token for the API.
- **Description**: Sends a request to fetch the user's steps data from the external API.

#### `recordFetchedSteps`
```solidity
function recordFetchedSteps(address _account) public
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_account`: The address of the user.
- **Description**: Records the fetched steps data for the user.

#### `takeRewardBasedOnShoeId`
```solidity
function takeRewardBasedOnShoeId(uint256 _shoeId) checkIfUserAlreadyClaimedDailyReward(msg.sender) public
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_shoeId`: The ID of the shoe.
- **Description**: Allows the user to claim their reward based on the shoe ID.

#### `_calculateRewardOfUserSteps`
```solidity
function _calculateRewardOfUserSteps(address _account, uint256 _shoeId) internal returns(uint256)
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_account`: The address of the user.
  - `_shoeId`: The ID of the shoe.
- **Description**: Calculates the reward for the user's steps based on the shoe ID.

#### `_calculateShareOfUsersStepsInSlot`
```solidity
function _calculateShareOfUsersStepsInSlot(address _account) internal returns(uint256)
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `_account`: The address of the user.
- **Description**: Calculates the user's share of steps in their slot.

### View Functions
- `getRewardDataOfUsers(address _account)`: Returns the reward data for a specific user.

### Modifiers
- `checkIfUserAlreadyClaimedDailyReward(address _account)`: Ensures the user has not already claimed their daily reward.
