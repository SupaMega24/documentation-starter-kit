## Front-End Technologies

Our application leverages a modern and powerful tech stack to deliver a seamless and efficient user experience. Below are the key technologies used on the front end:

### 1. **Next.js**
   - **Framework**: Next.js serves as the primary framework for our application, providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance out of the box. It helps in building scalable and SEO-friendly React applications with ease.

### 2. **Pinata**
   - **IPFS Integration**: We use Pinata to handle the uploading and storing of images on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This ensures decentralized and secure storage of media files, making them accessible and tamper-proof.

### 3. **Wagmi**
   - **Blockchain Interactions**: Wagmi is employed for seamless blockchain interactions. It simplifies connecting to the Ethereum network, handling wallets, and executing transactions, ensuring a smooth user experience when interacting with our smart contracts.

### 4. **NextAuth.js**
   - **Authentication**: For authentication, we utilize NextAuth.js, specifically implementing a Google login strategy. This allows users to securely log in using their Google accounts, ensuring both convenience and security.

### 5. **RainbowKit**
   - **Wallet Integration**: RainbowKit is integrated to provide users with a modern and user-friendly wallet connection experience. It supports a variety of wallet providers, making it easy for users to manage their blockchain assets within the application.

### 6. **Tailwind CSS**
   - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. Its utility-first approach allows us to create responsive and customizable UI components quickly, ensuring a consistent and polished design throughout the app.

### 7. **TypeScript**
   - **Static Typing**: TypeScript is employed to add static typing to our JavaScript codebase. This improves code quality, helps catch errors early in the development process, and enhances the overall maintainability of the application.
